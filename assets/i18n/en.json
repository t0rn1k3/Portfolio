    "ABOUT" : " My name is Tornike, I'm front end developer. From Gerogia, Tbilisi. I started my career as a developer few years ago, after I decided to explore this profession. I had to work with different programming laguages and frameworks during studying period, such as react, angular and flutter as front end frameworks and php and wordpress as back end language.  My first real project was built on wordpress, which I built with my three team members. After that, I started to learn javascript thoroughly, that helped me to master easily its frameworks in future. On this litte web-page I tried to show you all my knowledge and experiences I gain during studying period. You can see skills, that I have till today ans also, you can check out my projects, which you can see on Projects page. Thank you for your attention !  "
